<p>Our main focus for the first week was to get better situated with Github, Cloud9, Heroku, and git commands and to set up the foundation needed to work on our site. While becoming competent with Github, Cloud9, and Heroku was fairly easy after a little bit of tinkering around as a group, git commands and version control were another story. It took hours of trial-and-error, as well as the creation of our own git cheat sheet and reference guide, before we could comfortably pull the master doc, make an edit, add the edit for staging, commit the staged edit, push the newest version of the master, and merge the latest “master” files. To be honest, we are still not sure if we are doing the entire process correctly but we at least have replicable workflow that is allowing us to make progress on the project.</p>
<p>Steve (aka adventurous jackal) took on the daunting task of adding a location input on the create event page. Coding this at the HTML/CSS level was easy but the javascript was not initially disrupted, leading to a dead page. After struggling for ~3hrs he was able to hotfix the problem (and had newfound empathy for developers). Less than 3 minutes later he also found the “Project add event creation form with required field” video tutorial that told him exactly what he was doing wrong. </p>
<h3>Product Backlog</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Utilize branches in git</li>
    <li>Go to office hours everyday</li>
    <li>Header and footer elements for each page</li>
    <li>API for events</li>
    <li>Detail page for events</li>
    <li>Create all domains for site</li>
    <li>Team info in /about domain</li>
    <li>Team logo</li>
</ol>
<p>The next sprint focuses on fleshing out the different domains and generic structural components of each page (3, 5, 6, 7) as well as adopting a few new best practices (1, 2). We will also spend some time identifying a team logo if we have time. </p>
