<p>Our priority for this sprint was to add functionality to many of our pages. Of primary concern was our “events page” and “create event” page. Anoj and Anthony worked on the user interface-side by adding the necessary HTML/CSS components while Steve worked on the back-end validation testing. The HTML/CSS portion was pretty straightforward and we were able to get that up and running with minimal struggle. The validation testing, however, was more of a trial-and-error process with bug fixes sprinkled throughout. Finishing these two components and putting it together to form a functional page was by far the most gratifying part of this sprint. </p>
<p>After handling the larger stories, Steve and Anoj trimmed away at our backlog by switching our focus to smaller stories. These stories added significant detail to our website and provided fluidity to the user interface, such as with the footer and event links and about page content. Anthony, on the other hand, switched to graphic design mode and put together several great iterations of our team logo. After incorporating comments the team as a whole made, we decided on a final logo. Finally made the API and made sure it was searchable, all thanks to the videos on the class website. We used a similar approach with the Google analytics.</p>
<p>All in all, we are extremely satisfied with the progress made (and the number of tests we were passing) during this sprint.</p>
<h3>Product Backlog</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Visit Office Hours to learn how to create functionality for automatically generating event pages (events/0, etc.)</li>
    <li>Create functionality for automatically generating event pages. (events/0)</li>
    <li>Create A/B testing donation links.</li>
    <li>Utilize data from Google Analytics to determine the most effective manner to increase donations.</li>
    <li>Add customized CSS using style tags in the head of HTML files in order to prevent failure of Bootstrap CSS tasks while still creative a more fluid and attractive user experience.</li>
</ol>
<p>Our final sprint focuses first on finishing the remainder of the original project parameters—likely utilizing office hours on the sections that have given us the most trouble. We will then move to addressing the remainder of the curveball task that was brought to our attention during sprint 2. Finally, we plan to spend the remaining time working on non-essential CSS customization that will take our site from a bare bones experience to a much more attractive and user-friendly one.</p>
